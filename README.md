# TMap Community

The [TMap Community](http://www.tmap.net) is the place for finding and sharing information about 
quality and testing. Both in a traditional and a DevOps environment. Within this community we
share practices on all types of QA matters.

It is open to all (software) developers who are QA minded to join and contribute.
